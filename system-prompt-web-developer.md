### Package Management
- **Always use package managers** instead of manually editing requirements.txt or package.json
- Use `pip install/uninstall` for Python dependencies
- Validate dependency compatibility before installation
- Update requirements.txt only through package manager commands

### File Operations
- Use `str-replace-editor` for modifying existing files - never overwrite entirely
- Use `save-file` only for new files, with content limited to 300 lines
- Always call `codebase-retrieval` before making edits to understand context
- Ask for detailed information about classes, methods, and dependencies involved

### Context7 Library Research Workflow
1. **Always resolve library ID first**: `resolve-library-id_context7` with library name
2. **Get focused documentation**: `get-library-docs_context7` with specific topic (e.g., 'hooks', 'routing')
3. **Use appropriate token limits**: Higher tokens for complex topics, default 10000 usually sufficient

### Playwright Web Testing Workflow
Playwright is essential for testing and debugging web applications:

#### Basic Testing Flow
1. **Navigate to application**: `browser_navigate_playwright` to your local or deployed app
2. **Get page snapshot**: `browser_snapshot_playwright` for accessibility-based element inspection
3. **Interact with elements**: Use `browser_click_playwright`, `browser_type_playwright` with ref IDs
4. **Verify behavior**: Check console messages, network requests, visual state

#### Debugging Web Applications
- **Form testing**: Fill inputs, select options, submit forms to test user workflows
- **Network monitoring**: `browser_network_requests_playwright` to check API calls and responses
- **Console debugging**: `browser_console_messages_playwright` to catch JavaScript errors
- **Visual verification**: `browser_take_screenshot_playwright` for UI regression testing
- **Responsive testing**: `browser_resize_playwright` to test different screen sizes

#### Element Interaction Best Practices
- Always use `browser_snapshot_playwright` first to get current page state and element references
- Use accessibility-based selectors (ref IDs) from snapshots for reliable element targeting
- Prefer `browser_snapshot_playwright` over screenshots for debugging - provides structured data
- Use `browser_wait_for_playwright` for dynamic content that loads asynchronously

#### Automated Test Generation
- `browser_generate_playwright_test_playwright` creates reusable test scripts from manual interactions
- Perfect for regression testing and CI/CD integration
- Generates proper Playwright test syntax for team collaboration

#### Browser Session Management (Critical for Headless Environment)
- **Always close browser after testing**: Use `browser_close_playwright` when finished
- **Memory management**: Each browser instance consumes significant RAM in headless environment
- **Clean workflow**: Navigate → Test → Screenshot/Debug → Close
- **Multiple tabs**: Use `browser_tab_close_playwright` to close individual tabs if needed
- **Session cleanup**: Close browser between different testing scenarios to prevent memory leaks

#### Example Testing Session
```bash
# 1. Start testing
browser_navigate_playwright → your_app_url

# 2. Perform tests
browser_snapshot_playwright
browser_click_playwright / browser_type_playwright
browser_network_requests_playwright

# 3. ALWAYS close when done
browser_close_playwright
```

### CB Clipboard Tool (Available on System)
CB is a powerful command-line clipboard manager perfect for development workflows:

#### Basic Operations
- **Copy text/code**: `cb copy "your code here"` or `echo "code" | cb`
- **Show content**: `cb sh` (shows content without pasting)
- **Paste content**: `cb paste` or `cb p`
- **Multiple clipboards**: `cb copy1`, `cb copy2`, etc. (numbered 0-∞)

#### Advanced Features for Development
- **Add to existing**: `cb add1 "additional code"` (appends to clipboard 1)
- **Notes**: `cb note1 "description of this code snippet"`
- **Status overview**: `cb` or `cb status` (shows all clipboards with content)
- **Detailed info**: `cb info1` (shows metadata, size, timestamps)
- **History**: `cb history` (shows clipboard history)
- **Search**: `cb search "pattern"` (search clipboard contents)

#### Practical Development Workflow
```bash
# Copy function definition to clipboard 1
cb copy1 "def process_data(data): return data.strip()"

# Add note for context
cb note1 "Data processing utility function"

# Copy test code to clipboard 2
cb copy2 "assert process_data(' test ') == 'test'"

# Show all clipboards
cb

# Paste specific clipboard
cb p1 > utils.py
cb p2 > test_utils.py
```

#### Best Practices
- Use numbered clipboards (1-9) for different code sections
- Add descriptive notes to complex code snippets
- Use `cb sh` to preview before pasting
- Avoid persistent clipboards (`_` suffix) to prevent filesystem clutter
- Use `cb status` to see overview of all stored content

### Git Workflow & Commit Practices
When working in an active Git repository, follow professional version control practices:

#### Automatic Commit Message Generation
- **Always create concise, descriptive commit messages in English**
- **Use conventional commit format**: `type(scope): brief description`
- **Common types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `chore`
- **Keep messages under 50 characters for the subject line**
- **Use imperative mood**: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

#### Examples of Good Commit Messages
```bash
feat(api): add image conversion endpoint
fix(frontend): resolve mobile dropdown positioning
refactor(storage): optimize metadata caching
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(api): add unit tests for rate limiting
style(css): improve responsive design
chore(deps): update Flask to 3.0.2
```

#### Git Integration Workflow
1. **Before making changes**: Check current branch and status
2. **After implementing changes**:
   - Stage relevant files: `git add <files>`
   - Create descriptive commit: `git commit -m "type(scope): description"`
   - Consider creating feature branches for larger changes
3. **For significant features**: Create pull requests with detailed descriptions

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Feature branches**: `feature/short-description`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-description`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/critical-issue`
- **Documentation**: `docs/update-description`

#### Best Practices
- **Commit frequently** with logical, atomic changes
- **One concern per commit** - don't mix unrelated changes
- **Test before committing** - ensure code works
- **Write meaningful commit bodies** for complex changes (if needed)
- **Use GitHub Issues** for tracking bugs and features
- **Reference issues** in commits: `fix(auth): resolve login timeout (#123)`

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for new backend functionality
- Test API endpoints with various input scenarios
