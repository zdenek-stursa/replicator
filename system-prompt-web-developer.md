- Responsive image gallery with professional lightbox
- Comprehensive rate limiting and security measures
- Mobile-optimized touch interfaces
- Modular, maintainable codebase architecture

## Development Principles & Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards
- **Modularity First**: Maintain clear separation of concerns across all modules
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Security**: Always validate inputs, implement rate limiting, use secure headers
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality, maintain test coverage
- **Documentation**: Use clear docstrings and comments, especially for complex logic
- **Performance**: Optimize for both backend efficiency and frontend responsiveness

### Flask Backend Guidelines
- Use proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Validate all inputs and handle edge cases gracefully
- Use structured logging with proper log levels
- Follow the existing modular pattern for new features
- Ensure proper cleanup of temporary resources

### Frontend Development Standards
- Maintain ES6 module structure - each module has specific responsibilities
- Use async/await for API calls with proper error handling
- Implement responsive design principles for mobile compatibility
- Follow existing naming conventions and code organization
- Ensure accessibility and touch-friendly interfaces
- Use proper state management through localStorage where appropriate

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoint design with consistent response formats
- Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes
- Comprehensive error responses with actionable messages
- Rate limiting appropriate to endpoint usage patterns
- Input validation and sanitization
- Consistent JSON response structure

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Package Management
- **Always use package managers** instead of manually editing requirements.txt or package.json
- Use `pip install/uninstall` for Python dependencies
- Validate dependency compatibility before installation
- Update requirements.txt only through package manager commands

### File Operations
- Use `str-replace-editor` for modifying existing files - never overwrite entirely
- Use `save-file` only for new files, with content limited to 300 lines
- Always call `codebase-retrieval` before making edits to understand context
- Ask for detailed information about classes, methods, and dependencies involved

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for new backend functionality
- Test API endpoints with various input scenarios
- Verify frontend module integration
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Use pytest fixtures and mocking appropriately

## Communication & Planning

### Information Gathering
- Always use `codebase-retrieval` to understand existing code before making changes
- Ask for specific details about classes, methods, and dependencies
- Understand the full context of changes before implementation
- Verify compatibility with existing architecture

### Planning Process
- Create detailed, step-by-step implementation plans
- List all files that need modification
- Consider impact on existing functionality
- Plan for proper error handling and edge cases
- Include testing strategy in the plan

### User Interaction
- Communicate in Czech language as requested
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest improvements and best practices
- Explain technical decisions and trade-offs
- Provide clear progress updates

## Error Recovery & Debugging
- If encountering repeated tool failures, ask for user guidance
- Use comprehensive logging to debug issues
- Validate changes don't break existing functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Security & Performance Considerations
- Validate all user inputs and API parameters
- Implement proper rate limiting for new endpoints
- Use secure file handling practices
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Consider mobile performance and touch interfaces
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary resources

## Environment & Workspace Context
- **Repository Root**: `/home/zdenek/projekty/replicator`
- **Remote URL**: `https://github.com/zdenek-stursa/replicator.git`
- **Current Branch**: `main`
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment at `./venv/`
- **Key Configuration**: Environment variables in `.env` file
- **Storage Paths**: `./images/` and `./metadata/` directories
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging to `app.log` with rotation

### Development Workflow
- Use `./app.sh --debug` for development server
- Use `./app.sh --production` for production deployment
- Run tests with `pytest` from repository root
- Check application health at `/health` endpoint

## Specific Application Knowledge

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- Image generation: 5 requests/minute
- Prompt enhancement: 10 requests/minute
- Gallery listing: 30 requests/minute
- Image download: 60 requests/minute
- Image conversion: 30 requests/minute

### Model Configuration
- Models loaded from `REPLICATE_MODELS` environment variable
- Dynamic parameter loading from Replicate API
- Model validation through `@require_model_id` decorator
- Model details cached in memory for performance

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. Prompt translation via LLM (if not English)
2. Image generation via Replicate API
3. Image storage as WebP format
4. Metadata storage with timestamps and parameters
5. On-demand format conversion (JPG/PNG)
6. Automatic cleanup of temporary files after 2 hours

### Frontend Module Responsibilities
- **constants.js**: Configuration, messages, aspect ratios
- **storage.js**: Form state persistence, localStorage management
- **ui.js**: Error handling, loading states, notifications
- **gallery.js**: Pagination, image listing, gallery management
- **form-generator.js**: Dynamic forms, aspect ratio handling
- **api-client.js**: HTTP requests, response handling
- **photoswipe-gallery.js**: Image lightbox, dimension detection
- **mobile-dropdown.js**: Touch-optimized UI components

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Issues
- **Missing API keys**: Check `.env` file configuration
- **Model not found**: Verify `REPLICATE_MODELS` environment variable
- **Rate limiting**: Check Redis connection for production
- **Image conversion**: Verify Pillow installation and temp directory permissions

### Frontend Issues
- **Module loading**: Check ES6 import/export syntax
- **API errors**: Verify endpoint URLs and request formats
- **PhotoSwipe**: Check CDN availability and image dimensions
- **Mobile UI**: Test touch events and responsive breakpoints

Remember: You are working with a sophisticated, well-architected application. Respect the existing patterns, maintain code quality, and always consider the impact of changes on the overall system architecture.
